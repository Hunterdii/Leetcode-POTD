# üöÄ **1760 - Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag** üß†

## Problem Link:  
[**LeetCode - Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag**](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-limit-of-balls-in-a-bag/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-12-07)


## üí° **Problem Breakdown:**

You are tasked to minimize the maximum number of balls in a bag after performing at most `maxOperations`. Each operation allows dividing a bag of balls into two smaller bags. Here's how we break down the problem:

1. The goal is to minimize the "penalty," which is the largest number of balls in any bag after performing all operations.
2. The problem can be approached by evaluating whether a specific penalty value is achievable using the available operations.


## üîç **Example Walkthrough:**

### Example 1:  

**Input:**  
`nums = [9], maxOperations = 2`  

**Output:**  
`3`  

**Explanation:**  
- Start with one bag: `[9]`.  
- Operation 1: Divide `9` into `6` and `3` ‚Üí `[6, 3]`.  
- Operation 2: Divide `6` into `3` and `3` ‚Üí `[3, 3, 3]`.  

Now, the largest bag contains `3` balls, so the penalty is `3`.  


### Example 2:  

**Input:**  
`nums = [2, 4, 8, 2], maxOperations = 4`  

**Output:**  
`2`  

**Explanation:**  
- Start with bags `[2, 4, 8, 2]`.  
- Operation 1: Divide `8` into `4` and `4` ‚Üí `[2, 4, 4, 4, 2]`.  
- Operation 2: Divide one `4` into `2` and `2` ‚Üí `[2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2]`.  
- Operation 3: Divide another `4` into `2` and `2` ‚Üí `[2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2]`.  
- Operation 4: Divide the last `4` into `2` and `2` ‚Üí `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.  

Now, the largest bag contains `2` balls, so the penalty is `2`.  


### Constraints:
- $`1 \leq nums.length \leq 10^5`$  
- $`1 \leq maxOperations, nums[i] \leq 10^9`$  


## üéØ **My Approach:**

To minimize the penalty, we use **binary search** combined with a **greedy check**:

1. **Binary Search:**  
   - Search the penalty in the range `[1, max(nums)]`.  
   - Midpoint (`mid`) of the search range represents a candidate penalty.  

2. **Feasibility Check:**  
   - For each bag in `nums`, calculate how many splits are needed to make all resulting bags ‚â§ `mid`.  
   - Sum the operations required for all bags.  
   - If the total number of operations ‚â§ `maxOperations`, the candidate penalty is feasible.  

3. **Update Search Range:**  
   - If feasible, try a smaller penalty (`right = mid - 1`).  
   - If not feasible, increase the penalty (`left = mid + 1`).  


## üïí **Time Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  $`O(n \log(max(nums)))`$  
  - `O(\log(max(nums)))` for binary search.  
  - `O(n)` to evaluate feasibility for each candidate penalty.  

- **Space Complexity:**  
  $`O(1)`$: No additional space beyond the input.

## üìù **Solution Code**

## Code (C):

```c
bool canDivide(int* nums, int numsSize, int maxSize, int maxOperations) {
    int operations = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        operations += (nums[i] - 1) / maxSize;
        if (operations > maxOperations) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int minimumSize(int* nums, int numsSize, int maxOperations) {
    int left = 1, right = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > right) right = nums[i];
    }

    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (canDivide(nums, numsSize, mid, maxOperations)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return left;
}
```

## Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int maxOperations) {
        int left = 1, right = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int operations = 0;

            for (int num : nums) {
                operations += (num - 1) / mid;
                if (operations > maxOperations) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                    goto nextIteration; 
                }
            }
            right = mid;

        nextIteration:;
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    private boolean canDivide(int[] nums, int maxSize, int maxOperations) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            operations += (num - 1) / maxSize;
            if (operations > maxOperations) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public int minimumSize(int[] nums, int maxOperations) {
        int left = 1, right = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int num : nums) {
            right = Math.max(right, num);
        }

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canDivide(nums, mid, maxOperations)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumSize(self, nums: List[int], maxOperations: int) -> int:
        def canDivide(maxSize: int) -> bool:
            return sum((num - 1) // maxSize for num in nums) <= maxOperations

        left, right = 1, max(nums)
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if canDivide(mid):
                right = mid  
            else:
                left = mid + 1  
        return left
```

## Code (Rust)

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn minimum_size(nums: Vec<i32>, max_operations: i32) -> i32 {
        fn can_divide(nums: &Vec<i32>, max_size: i32, max_operations: i32) -> bool {
            nums.iter()
                .map(|&num| (num - 1) / max_size)
                .sum::<i32>() <= max_operations
        }

        let (mut left, mut right) = (1, *nums.iter().max().unwrap());

        while left < right {
            let mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if can_divide(&nums, mid, max_operations) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        left
    }
}
```
